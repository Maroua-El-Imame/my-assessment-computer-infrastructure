## Introduction  

This notebook has been prepared to document the development and completion of the tasks assigned in Computer Infrastructure module's assessment.   
It follows the structure outlined in the assignment sheet and addresses each task in the order provided.   


## Purpose & Target Audience  

The purpose of this is to communicate the findings in a structured and comprehensible manner.  
The work is intended for computing professionals (such as a prospective employer) who may not be familiar with the specific tools, libraries, or programming languages employed.  
The notebook code and markdown sections are organized with concise explanations to facilitate understanding of the workflow.  
Resulys and visualizations are presented with clear descriptions to emphasize the key insights.  


## Assessment Problems

#### 🔹Problem 1: Data from yfinance  
 _Retrieving and preparing data_  
- Created a function `get_data()` to download hourly stock data for the past five days for the FAANG companies and save it as timestamped CSV files in a dedicated `data` folder.



#### 🔹Problem 2: Plotting Data  
 _Visualizing data_  
- Created a function `plot_data()` to read the latest stock data and generate a plot of the closing prices for the five FAANG companies, saving the plot as a timestamped PNG file in a dedicated `plots` folder.


#### 🔹Problem 3: Script
 _Execute a Python script_

## Environment Setup  

| Python in Git     |
|----------|

- Navigate to [github](https://github.com/)
- Click Sign up.
- Follow the prompts to create your personal account.  
***  
- Go to github.
- Log in to your account.
- Click the new repository button in the top-right **'+'** symbol
- Follow [steps](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-new-repository)
- Click create repository.  
***
- On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the repository.
- Under the repository name, select the code dropdown menu.
- Click Create codespace on main.
<br /> 
- From menu top left click on View > Explorer  
- Under repository title ( in bold) click on New file  
- Lower case file name, then add .ipynb extension  
- Follows steps from coding to committing then lastly syncing changes.

| Python on Windows     |
|----------|

[Download cmder](https://cmder.app/)  
[Download notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/)  
[Download anaconda (python)](https://www.anaconda.com/download)   
[Download vs code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)


    
-   Open VS Code and select "File > New File",  
    Save the file as .py format (e.g., my_script.py).   
    Write a Python script in the file.  

-   With Python file open in VS Code, launch the terminal (see vscode menu)   
    Navigate through the terminal until reaching the same directory where Python file is located.  
    Possible to use Cmder for running Python code for '.py' files. Same as in Vs code, navigate to the directory where the Python file is saved using the cd command.  

-   Cmder is mainly for command-line usage, while VS Code is where would most of coding and debugging run.   
    
-   Lastly, steps to [clone repository using command line](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)   
    Clone allows to copy the repository from GitHub to the local machine   
    Changes can be pushed to the remote repository on GitHub and/or pulled from Github into the local machine.
